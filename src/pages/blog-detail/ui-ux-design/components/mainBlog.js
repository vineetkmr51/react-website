                  demands disband. Let’s see what 2022 has got in its bucket!
                </p>

                
                <p>
                  AR and VR have already been rocking in the market but these
                  technologies are going to be a dominant UI UX trend in 2022
                  and beyond. The AR VR trend is going to amplify further as it
                  is expected to strive further into the B2B industry.
                  Innumerable opportunities for this process have been generated
                  due to the pandemic situation in form of increasing
                  virtualization of everyday social activities.
                </p>
                <h5>Voice user interface</h5>
               
                <p>
                  Alexa is the new friend of so many people nowadays! Just like
                  Alexa, there are many voice assistants like Google Home,
                  Google Nest, Apple’s Siri, etc. that are a few top favorites
                  of digital device users. This points towards the on-rise trend
                  of voice user interface inclusion in modern apps. A
                  significant section of app users prefers voice commands over
                  taps and clicks due to the former’s efficiency and convenience
                  quotient.
                </p>
              
                <p>
                  A trend that is surely going to be one of the best UI/UX
                  design trends in 2022 and even beyond is the use of
                  microinteractions. These interactions are meant to keep users
                  more informed and aware of whatever they do in the app.
                  Microinteractions are also a significant aid to the
                  programming part of UX development. Some of the major elements
                  of this trend include tactile reviews, shade changing ability,
                  adding animations in ongoing transitions, loading
                  visualization, etc. The primary aim of introducing
                  microinteractions to any app or website is to make user
                  interactions more amiable. Users tend to stick to any app for
                  longer when they can feel a uniquely unusual connection with
                  the resources presented. This further proves beneficial to the
                  app owners in terms of boosted brand reputation and loyalty.
                </p>
                <h5>Superapps</h5>
                
                <p>
                  As people rely more on apps, there has emerged Superapps!
                  Proving true to their name, Superapps are single platforms for
                  a variety of activities that users can perform. Developing
                  these multi-functional apps is a great app design trend 2022
                  that is going to mark the take over of one app-one purpose
                  model. Superapps have a distinctive purpose- creating singular
                  ecosystems for users to increase retention rates and brand
                  loyalty. Some popular examples of superapps include WeChat,
                  Gojek, Natural AI, etc. This trend set in 2021 and is expected
                  to go much further in the future despite the challenges
                  involved. App developers are expected to focus on maintaining
                  smoother in-app navigability and feature discoverability while
                  writing UX for superapps.

                <h5>Metaverse</h5>
               
                <p>
                  A trend that has recently created a big buzz in the tech world
                  is Metaverse. The term has been coined by Facebook that
                  implies a digital environment consisting of users and devices
                  connected through VR technology. Metaverse is an attempt at
                  utilizing VR devices to create a coherent virtual space that
                  allows users to do much more with just one technology.
                  Facebook’s Metaverse consists of Horizon workrooms where users
                  can create their avatars and perform several activities with
                  the Oculus Quest 2 wearables. Metaverse is very fresh right
                  now but holds huge potential towards being a major app trend
                  in 2022 and further. Its parent company, Facebook, is also
                  promoting it big and hiring a large workforce for its
                  expansion.
                </p>
                <h4 id="">So, what can make an app design successful?</h4>
                <p>
                  To begin with, designing apps with first-rate standards and
                  user-specific elements picked from the thorough market and
                  audience research is never losing vogue. It would be safe to
                  say that ever-trending apps are those that contain perfect
                  interactions, keep the users engaged, and deliver the right
                  goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the ways to design such an enriching app UX is focusing
                  on user preferences. A proper and deep user engagement and
                  behavior research is vital to ensure app success. Alongside, a
                  deep touch of creative and analytical thinking from the
                  developers’ side will lead to the creation of a superlative
                  application meant for the future. It is also important to
                  minimize conflict between the design and app functionalities.
                  What we mean to say is that the design should be as truly
                  expressive of the functionalities as possible. As a&nbsp;
                
                  &nbsp; we emphasize presenting truthfully expressive app
                  designs to best exhibit our client’s app goals.
                </p>

                <h4 id="">In conclusion…</h4>
                <p>
                  Next year is going to bring unique possibilities that will be
                  directed towards bringing users closer together through
                  different technologies. While apps and websites would be the
                  major medium, UI/UX designers would face the major challenge
                  of making apps with high adaptability and liveliness factor.
                  The need would be to develop apps that are future-proof,
                  exciting, and most importantly, user-focused. However, it
                  should not be forgotten that everything cannot be achieved at
                  once. The idea should be, therefore, to design and develop
                  apps that achieve what they aim.
                </p>
